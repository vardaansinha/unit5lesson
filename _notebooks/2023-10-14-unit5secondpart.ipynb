    "# Topic 5.4: Accessor Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "In Java, classes serve as blueprints for creating objects. These classes can encapsulate attributes (fields) and behaviors (methods). One of the cornerstones of Object-Oriented Programming is **data encapsulation**. This principle restricts direct access to some of an object's components, ensuring data integrity and security. Accessor methods, colloquially known as \"getters\", offer a controlled means to access these attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Accessor Methods\n",
    "\n",
    "An **Accessor Method** permits other objects to retrieve the value of instance or static variables. They are typically non-void methods without parameters that return a value.\n",

    "For instance, consider a class `Circle`:"
